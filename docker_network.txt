suppose i have one network called my network. and in this network, there are total 4 containers connected with each other.

now, we can imagine as each conainer is one individual system. so each container have their IP address.

My-network
|
|
------container 1  192.168.144.1
|
|
------container 2 192.168.144.7
|
|
------conainer 3 192.168.144.5
|
|
-------container 4 192.168.144.6

now command of networking in docker.

To find all network in docker

- docker network ls
    (it will return all the network which are in my system on docker)

- docker network inspect <network_name>
    (it will return all network details about each containers in docker-network)

- as i mention earlier that each container is works as individual system. so we can create directory into each container

- now i want to copy one file which located at my local system into docker container.
    - my file location is : submit/data.csv and i want paste this file into container 1 in /temp.
    command:
            docker cp <local_system_file_path> <container_name>/<container_file_path>
            docker cp submit/data.csv container1/temp
            so, if there is no directory /temp in docker than this command will create direcatory and paste the file into this directory from local.
